# Kata 1/10 - Fizzbuzz

The FizzBuzz Problem:

Print integers from 1 to 101, but printing "Fizz" if an integer is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if an integer is divisible by 5,
and FizzBuzz if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5.

## Usage

This repository is part of my personal challenge of solving katas during 10 days consecutives using Clojure.
